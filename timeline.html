                    <p>During quarantine the world was forced to isolate from one another to keep ourselves and others
                        safe. Even during a lockdown we were able to utilize out technology to keep in contact with
                        friends, family, and loved ones. This is what first started my interest in coding an computer
                        science. I got my first ‚Äútech job‚Äù as a teen coder with Artist for Huamnity. Here I learned the
                        basics of web-development and had opportunities to work with clientel.

                    <p>During the Summer of 2021 I attended a ton of hackathons and coding conferences including,
                        Stemposition 2021, Waffle Hacks 2021, and Harvard WeCode 2021. This further inspired me to
                        purusre technology and exposed me to many new fields like project management, game development,
                        Ui/Ux design, AR and Vr, and machine leaning

                    <p>I participated in the Girls Who Code virtual summer immersion camp in 2021. Here I fine-tuned my
                        web-development skills and got to create projects for fun that were personolized to me. I
                        learned more about the inequities among men and woman in the tech field and started to dedicate
                        myself to bridging that gap.

                    <p>That summer I also participated in the Kode with Klossy two-week summer program for young women
                        and non-binary individuals. During these two weeks I learned to build mobile apps in ios using
                        swift. A group of coders and I, created Zootopic, a virtual zoo experience for youth
                        that could be used to educate them on animals and wild-life. One of my favorite projects so far!
